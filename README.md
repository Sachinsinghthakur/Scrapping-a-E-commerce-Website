# File and Folder Structure

- I followed the default srapy's project structure for the assignment.
- All scrapy-related code is placed directly in project folder leclercProducts and subdirectory with the same name (leclercProducts).
- The Screenshots folder along with project folder LeclercProducts contain the screenshot of terminal with request and response and I also added the screenshot
  of my cloud mongo db cluster images containing the database and all its collection.
- The spider created for crawling the web pages is in the spider folder with name leclerc_spider.py.
- pipeline.py and settings.py file is edited corrospond to the leclerc_spider.py
